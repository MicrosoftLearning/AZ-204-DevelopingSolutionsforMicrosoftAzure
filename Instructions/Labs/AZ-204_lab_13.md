# Lab 13: Create and configure an Azure web app

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will deploy and configure an Azure Web App that integrates with GitHub. The web app will be a simple implementation of a single-page web app accessible only to internal employees. The website will host content related to company strategies and division sales goals.

To create the web app, you will use the Azure portal and connect it to a GitHub repository. To do this, you will need a free GitHub account, where you will upload the sample website content provided as part of this lab. Once the web app is up and running, you will make changes to the content and watch as the GitHub content is synced to the web app, using the CI/CD methodology.

Because this is an employee-only web app, you will need to secure access to the web app by creating users in Azure AD and implementing security for the web app through user authentication.

1. Drag and drop the sample web app code files from the folder on your computer to the GitHub upload page.

1. Add a commit message that describes the changes you made (e.g. "Initial commit of sample web app code").

1. Click on "Commit changes" to upload the sample web app code to the repository.


#### Task 2: Create the web app in the Azure portal and connect it to the GitHub account

1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and then sign in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

1. On the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Create a resource** button in the left-hand menu.

1. On the search bar, type **Web App** and select **Web App** from the list of options.

1. Monitor the health of the instances added by the auto scaling group to ensure they are functioning properly.

1. Repeat the test several times to ensure the auto scaling group is working consistently.

That's it! You have successfully tested the scaling of your web app using your auto scaling group. If you encounter any issues during the testing process, review the configuration of your auto scaling group and adjust as necessary.

#### Review 

This exercise is about enabling autoscaling for a web app. Autoscaling allows the web app to automatically adjust its capacity based on demand, ensuring that it can handle fluctuations in traffic and usage without manual intervention. The goal of the exercise is to provide practical experience in configuring auto scaling groups for web apps and to demonstrate the importance of autoscaling in ensuring that web apps can handle varying levels of traffic and usage.
