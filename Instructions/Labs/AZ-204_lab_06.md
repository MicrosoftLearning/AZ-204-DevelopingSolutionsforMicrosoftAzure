# Lab 06: Authenticate by using OpenID Connect, MSAL, and .NET SDKs

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:
    
-   Microsoft Edge
-   Visual Studio Code

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will register an application in Microsoft Entra ID, add a user, and then test the user’s access to the application to validate that Entra ID can secure it.

### Exercise 1: Configure a single-tenant Entra ID environment

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the open browser window, browse to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and then sign in with the account you'll use for this lab.

    > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour and begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Register an application in Entra ID Directory

1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Entra ID** and, in the list of results, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

    > **Note**: This redirects your browser session to the blade of the Microsoft Entra ID tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

1. On the **Microsoft Entra ID** blade, select **App registrations** in the **Manage** section.

1. In the **App registrations** section, select **+ New registration**.

1. In the **Register an application** section, perform the following actions, and then select **Register**:

#### Task 5: Create a Microsoft Entra ID user

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a the Cloud Shell. If Cloud Shell defaults to a Bash session, select **Switch to PowerShell** in the **Cloud Shell** menu and then select **Confirm**.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

    If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell** you will be presented with a series of prompts to create the resource. Perform the actions presented in the following table:

    | Prompt | Action |
    |--|--|
    | Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell | Select **PowerShell**. |
    | Getting Started | Select **Mount storage account**, then select your **Storage account subscription** from the drop-down, and finally select **Apply**. |
    | Mount storage account | Select **We will create a storage account for you**, and then select **Next**. |

1. In the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to sign in to the Microsoft Entra tenant associated with your Azure subscription:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```

1. Run the following command to retrieve and display the primary Domain Name System (DNS) domain name of the Microsoft Entra tenant:

    ```powershell
    $aadDomainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
    $aadDomainName
    ```

    > **Note**: Record the value of the DNS domain name. You'll use this value later in the lab.

1. Run the following commands to create Microsoft Entra ID users that you'll use to test Microsoft Entra ID authentication:

    ```powershell
    $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
    $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
    $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
    New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'aad_lab_user1' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'aad_lab_user1' -UserPrincipalName "aad_lab_user1@$aadDomainName" 
    ```

1. Run the following command to identify the user principal name (UPN) of the newly created Microsoft Entra ID user:

    ```powershell
    (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'aad_lab_user1'").UserPrincipalName
    ```

    > **Note**: Record the UPN. You'll use this value later in the lab.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Review

In this exercise, you registered a single-tenant Azure AD application and created an Azure AD user account.

### Exercise 2: Create a single-tenant ASP.NET web app

#### Task 1: Create an ASP.NET web app project

1. On the lab computer, start **Command Prompt**.

1. From the command prompt, run the following commands to create and set the current directory to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Starter\\OIDCClient**:

    ```cmd
    F:
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\06\Starter\OIDCClient
    ```

1. Run the following commands to create a new .NET Core web app based on the Model View Controller (MVC) template (replace the placeholders `<application_ID>`, `<tenant_ID>`, and `<domain_Name>` with the corresponding values you recorded earlier in this lab):

    ```cmd
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <application_ID> --tenant-id <tenant_ID> --domain <domain_Name>
    rmdir .\obj /S /Q
    ```
    
    > **Note**: If you received an error in the terminal, it is possible you're using PowerShell. It that case remove the `/S /Q` flags and rerun the command.

1. Run the following command to start Visual Studio Code. 

    ```cmd
    code .
    ```
    > If you have been prompted **Do you trust the authors of all files in this folder?**, select **Yes, I trust the authors**.


1. In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, review the autogenerated folder structure that represents an MVC web app.

1. Navigate to the **Properties** folder, open the **launchSettings.json** file, and then apply the following changes:

    
    | Section | Property | Value |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | **iisSettings** | **sslPort** | **44321** |
    | **https**  | **applicationUrl** | `https://localhost:5001` |
    

    > **Note**: The port numbers must match the value you specified when creating the Microsoft Entra ID app registration.

1. Save and close the file.

1. In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, select **OIDCClient.csproj**.

1. Ensure that the value of `<TargetFramework>` element is set to **net8.0**.

1. Ensure that version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect` NuGet packages is set to **8.0.0**.

1. Verify that the content of the **OIDCClient.csproj** file resembles the following listing (the value of the `UserSecretsId`will differ) and save the changes.

    ```csharp
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>

        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.DownstreamApi" Version="2.13.0" />
      </ItemGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

1. Close the **OIDCClient.csproj** file.

1. Navigate to the **Views\Shared** folder, and then open the **_LoginPartial.cshtml** file.

1. Verify that the `asp-area` attribute in each span element references `MicrosoftIdentity`, as in the following line:

    ```csharp
    <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut">Sign out</a>
    ```

1. Close the file without making any changes.

1. Open the file **appsettings.json** in the root folder and review the content of the **AzureAd** object, including the following elements:

    | Element | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | `Instance` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`|
    | `Domain` | Primary DNS domain of the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription |
    | `TenantId` | GUID of the Azure AD tenant |
    | `ClientId` | Application (client) ID of the application you registered in the Azure AD tenant |
    | `CallbackPath` | `/signin-oidc` |

1. Close the file without making any changes.

1. In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, select **Program.cs**.

1. Verify that the file contains the following **using** directives:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI;
    ```

1. Verify that the file contains the following lines that add the relevant authentication services to the container:

    ```csharp
    // Add services to the container.
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
      .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
    ```

1. Verify that the file contains the following lines that add a controller and Razor pages for the accounts management:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
      .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
    ```

1. Save and close the file.

### Task 2: Test the single-tenant web app in a single-tenant scenario

1. In the **Visual Studio Code** window, from its top menu bar, go to **Terminal** menu and select **New Terminal**.

1. In the **Terminal** panel, the current path of current working directory should be **F:\Allfiles\Labs\06\Starter\OIDCClient**. Run the following commands to build the .NET web app:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

    > **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the files in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Solution\\OIDCClient** folder. Ignore any warning messages.

1. Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate and configure the local computer to trust it:

    ```
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    ```

1. If prompted to install the autogenerated certificate, select **Yes**.

1. From the terminal prompt, run the following command to run the .NET web app:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Start the Microsoft Edge browser in the **InPrivate** mode, and then navigate to the `https://localhost:5001` URL.

1. If presented with the **Your connection isn't private** message, select **Advanced**, and then select the **Continue to localhost (unsafe)** link.

1. In the open browser window, when prompted, authenticate by using the UPN of the **aad_lab_user1** Microsoft Entra ID account you created earlier in this lab with **Pa55w.rd1234** as its password.

    > **Note**: If you are prompted with a **Help us protect your account** window, select **Skip for now**.

    > **Note**: If you are presented with the message **Need admin approval**, then you will need to use a Microsoft Entra ID with elevated privileges instead to complete the remainder of this task. To do so, select the link **Have an admin account? Sign in with that account**, sign in with an admin account, and proceed to the next step.

1. The browser window will automatically open the **Permissions requested** webpage.

1. Review the requested permissions, which include **View your basic profile** and **Maintain access to data you have given it access to**.

1. Select **Accept**.

1. Review the **Welcome** home page of the target site displayed by the browser and verify that the UPN of the **aad_user1** Microsoft Entra ID account appears in the browser window.

1. On the **Welcome** page, select **Sign out**.

1. When prompted to select the account to sign out, select the **aad_lab_user1** Microsoft Entra ID account. You'll be automatically redirected to the **Signed out** page.

1. Close the Microsoft Edge browser.
