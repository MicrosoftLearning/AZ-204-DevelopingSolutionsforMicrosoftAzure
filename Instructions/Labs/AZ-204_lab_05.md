# Lab 05: Deploying compute workloads by using images and containers

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment will be provided by your instructor.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:    
-   Microsoft Edge

-   File Explorer

### Exercise 1: Create a VM by using the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>), and then sign-in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

   > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. If you prefer to skip the tour, select **Get Started** to begin using the portal.


#### Task 2: Create a resource group

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Create a resource** link.

    > **Note**: If you can't find the **Create a resource** link, the **Create a resource** icon is a plus sign (+) character from the portal.

1.  On the **Create a resource** blade, in the **Search services and marketplace** text box, enter the text **Resource Group**, and then select Enter.

1.  On the **Marketplace** search results blade, select the **Resource group** result.

1.  On the **Resource group** blade, select **Create**.

1.  On the **Create a resource group** blade, observe the tabs from the blade, such as **Basics**, **Tags**, and **Review + create**.

    > **Note**: Each tab represents a step in the workflow to create a new resource group. You can select **Review + create** at any time to skip the remaining tabs.

1.  On the **Basics** tab, perform the following actions, and select **Review + create**:
    
    | Setting                         | Action                      |
    | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |

    | **Resource group** text box     | Enter **ContainerCompute**. |
    | **Region** drop-down list       | Select **(US) East US**.    |
    
    
    
    ![Create a resource group blade](./Media/l05_create_a_resource_group.png)
   
1.  From the **Review + create** tab, review the options that you selected during the previous steps.

1.  Select **Create** to create the resource group by using your specified configuration.  

    > **Note**: Wait for the creation task to complete before moving forward with this lab.

#### Task 3: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box prompts you to configure the shell. Select **Bash**, review the selected subscription, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If you don't notice the **Cloud Shell** configuration options, this is most likely because you're using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you're using a new subscription.

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, enter the following command, and then select Enter to get the version of the Azure CLI tool:

    ```
    az --version
    ```

#### Task 4: Use the Azure CLI commands

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of subgroups and commands at the root level of the CLI:

    ```
    az vm --help
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of arguments and examples for the **Create Virtual Machine** command:

    ```
    az vm create --help
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to create a new **virtual machine** with the following settings:
    
    -	Resource group: **ContainerCompute**

    -	Name: **quickvm**

    -	Image: **Debian**

    -	Admin-Username: **student**

    -	Admin-Password: **StudentPa55w.rd**

    ```
    az vm create --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm --image Debian --admin-username student --admin-password StudentPa55w.rd
    ```

    > **Note**: Wait for the VM creation process to complete. After the process completes, the command will return a JSON file containing details about the machine.

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a more detailed JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that contains various metadata about the newly created VM:

    ```
    az vm show --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to list all the IP addresses associated with the VM:

    ```
    az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to filter the output to only return the first IP address value:

    ```
    az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to store the results of the previous command in a new Bash shell variable named *ipAddress*:

    ```
    ipAddress=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv)
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to render the value of the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```
    echo $ipAddress
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to connect to the VM that you created earlier in this lab by using the Secure Shell (SSH) tool and the IP address stored in the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```
    ssh student@$ipAddress
    ```

1.  The SSH tool informs you that the authenticity of the host can’t be established and then asks if you want to continue connecting. Enter **yes**, and then select Enter to continue connecting to the VM.

1.  The SSH tool then asks for a password. Enter **StudentPa55w.rd**, and then select Enter to authenticate with the VM.

1.  After connecting to the VM by using SSH, enter the following command, and then select Enter to get metadata describing the Linux VM:

    ```
    uname -a
    ```

1.  Use the **exit** command to end your SSH session:

    ```
    exit
    ```

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane in the portal.

1.  In the **Containers** section, review the list of **Events**.

1.  Select the **Logs** tab, and then review the text logs from the container instance.

> **Note**: You can also optionally find the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

> **Note**: After the application finishes running, the container terminates because it has completed its work. For the manually created container instance, you indicated that a successful exit was acceptable, so the container ran once. The automatically created instance didn't offer this option, and it assumes the container should always be running, so you'll notice repeated restarts of the container.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were also able to customize the deployment further and to run task-based applications as part of a container run.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box prompts you to configure the shell. Select **Bash**, review the selected subscription, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If you don't notice Cloud Shell configuration options, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **ContainerCompute** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name ContainerCompute --no-wait --yes
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane in the portal.

   > **Note:** You will not receive a confirmation prompt. The command works in the background and will remove the specified resource group and related resources. 

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

-   Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
