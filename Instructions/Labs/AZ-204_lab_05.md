    ```
    az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute-[deployId] --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv
    ```

1.  Run the following command to store the results of the previous command in a new Bash shell variable named *ipAddress*:

    ```
    ipAddress=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute-[deployId] --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv)
    ```

1.  Run the following command to render the value of the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```
    echo $ipAddress
    ```

1.  Run the following command to connect to the VM that you created previously in this lab, by using the Secure Shell (SSH) tool and the IP address stored in the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```
    ssh student@$ipAddress
    ```

1.  The SSH tool informs you that the authenticity of the host can’t be established and then asks if you want to continue connecting. Enter **yes**, and then select Enter to continue connecting to the VM.

1.  The SSH tool then asks for a password. Enter **StudentPa55w.rd**, and then select Enter to authenticate with the VM.

1.  After connecting to the VM by using SSH, run the following command to get metadata describing the Linux VM:

    ```
    uname -a
    ```

1.  Use the **exit** command to end your SSH session:

    ```
    exit
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, run the following command to get a list of all container registries in your subscription:

    ```
    az acr list
    ```

1.  Run the following command, ensuring you see the name of your registry as output. If you see no output other than '[]', wait a minute and try running the command again:

    ```
    az acr list --query "max_by([], &creationDate).name" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Run the following command:

    ```
    acrName=$(az acr list --query "max_by([], &creationDate).name" --output tsv)
    ```

1.  Run the following command:

    ```
    echo $acrName
    ```

#### Task 5: Deploy a Docker container image to Container Registry

1.  Select the **Logs** tab, and then review the text logs from the container instance.

> **Note**: You can also optionally find the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

> **Note**: After the application finishes running, the container terminates because it has completed its work. For the manually created container instance, you indicated that a successful exit was acceptable, so the container ran once. The automatically created instance didn't offer this option, and it assumes the container should always be running, so you'll notice repeated restarts of the container.

> **Congratulations!** You have successfully completed this task. Please validate your progress by clicking on **(...) icon** and switch to **Lab Validation** tab and then click on **Validate** button for the respective task.     

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were able to customize the deployment further and to run task-based applications as part of a container run.
