# Lab 08: Create a multi-tier solution by using Azure services

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:
    
-   Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this proof of concept, you will create a containerized application to host a web app on Azure, as the source of information for the API. You will then build an API proxy using the Azure API Management capabilities to expose and test your APIs. Developers can query the APIs to test the service and validate its applicability.
