# Lab 14: Implement containerized solutions

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will explore how to create and deploy containers to the Container Registry using a .NET application and Docker files.

1. In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and then sign in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

1. Select **+ Create a resource** in the top left corner of the page.

1. In the search bar, type **Container Registry** and select **Container Registry** from the results.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create Container Registry** page, fill out the following information (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Subscription** text box | Retain the default value |
    | **Resource group** section | Select **Create new**, enter **acr-sam-rg**, and then select **OK** |
    | **Registry name** section | enter **acrsam**_[yourname]_ |
    | **Location** drop-down list | Select **East US** |

1. Select the **Review + create** to review your settings, and then select **Create**.

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This can take a few minutes.

1. On the **Overview** blade, select the **Go to resource** button to navigate to the blade of the newly created container registry account.

1. On the **Container registry** blade, in the **Settings** section, select **Access keys**.

1. On the **Access keys** blade, enable the **Admin user**.

1. Copy the value of **username** box to the clipboard.

    ```docker

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 5151

    ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:5151

    # Creates a non-root user with an explicit UID and adds permission to access the /app folder
    # For more info, please refer to https://aka.ms/vscode-docker-dotnet-configure-containers
    RUN adduser -u 5678 --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser && chown -R appuser /app
    USER appuser

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
    ARG configuration=Release
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["<web-app-name>.csproj", "./"]
    RUN dotnet restore "<web-app-name>.csproj"
    COPY . .
    WORKDIR "/src/."
    RUN dotnet build "<web-app-name>.csproj" -c $configuration -o /app/build

    FROM build AS publish
    ARG configuration=Release
    RUN dotnet publish "<web-app-name>.csproj" -c $configuration -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

    FROM base AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "<web-app-name>.dll"]

    ```

1. Make sure to replace `<web-app-name>` with the name of your .NET 8 web application project.

1. Save the **Dockerfile**.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Docker file.

1. Return to the currently open Terminal **Command Prompt** window. Wait for the sign-in process to finish.

1. Enter the following command, and then select Enter to change the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\14\\Starter\\webapp-lab14** directory that contains the lab files:

    ```
    cd 'F:\Allfiles\Labs\14\Starter\webapp-lab14\'
    ```

1. Run the following command to upload the source code to your container registry and build the container image as a Container Registry task,
   replace <your-registry-name> with the name of your Container Registry and replace <image-name> with a new name for your image:

    ```
    az acr build --registry <your-registry-name> --image <image-name>:latest .
    ```
    
    > **Note**: Wait for the build task to complete before moving forward with this lab.

2. Close the **Terminal** pane.

3. Open the Azure portal and navigate to your Container Registry.

4. On the **Container registry** blade, in the **Services** section, select **Repositories**.

5. Verify that your Docker image is listed in the repository.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Linux container on Azure using a Docker file.

#### Task 4: Deploy Linux container image to an Azure container instance

    | **Ports protocol** drop-down list | Select **TCP** in the list |

1. Select the **Review + create** to review your settings, and then select **Create**.

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This can take a few minutes.

1. On the **Overview** blade, select the **Go to resource** button to navigate to the blade of the newly created container instance account.

1. Copy the public IP address of the container and paste it into your web browser with the port number then press enter.

   `<public-IP-number>:<port-number>` or `<DNS-name>:<port-number>`

1. You should see the web page of the .NET web application.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Linux container to your Container instance.

#### Task 5: Query the container registry for existing containers

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Resource Group that you created earlier.

1. Select the Container Registry that you created in Task 4.

1. Select on the **Repositories** tab and then select the repository that you want to query for existing containers.

1. In the **Tags** section, you can view the list of tags for the selected repository.

1. Select a tag to view the details of the container image. This will show you the metadata for the container image, including the size, creation date, and any associated layers.

1. You can also search for specific container images by using the search bar at the top of the page. Simply enter a keyword or tag name and select the **Search** button.
   
1. If you want to delete a container image, select the tag and then select the **Delete** button.
   
   > **Note**: This will permanently delete the container image and it cannot be recovered.

That's it! You have successfully learned how to query the Container Registry for existing containers.
