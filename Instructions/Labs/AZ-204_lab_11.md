# Lab 11: Monitor services that are deployed to Azure

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:
    
-   Microsoft Edge
-   File Explorer
-   Visual Studio Code
-   Azure PowerShell

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will create an Application Insights resource in Azure that will be used to monitor and log application insight data for later review. The API will be set to automatically scale if demand increases to a certain threshold and logging the data will help determine how the service is being utilized.
