# Lab 01: Build a web application on Azure platform as a service offering

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:

- Microsoft Edge
- File Explorer
- Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will explore how to create a web application on Azure by using the PaaS model. After the web application is created, you will learn how to upload existing web application files by using the Apache Kudu zip deployment option. You will then view and test the newly deployed web application.

### Exercise 1: Build a backend API by using Azure Storage and the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and then sign in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

   > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. If you prefer to skip the tour, select **Maybe later** to begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Create a Storage account

1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Storage Accounts**, and then in the list of results, select **Storage Accounts**.

1. On the **Storage accounts** blade, select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create a storage account** blade, on the **Basics** tab, perform the following actions, and then select **Review**:

    | Setting | Action |
    |--|--|
    | **Subscription** drop-down list | Retain the default value |
    | **Resource group** section | Select **Create new**, enter **ManagedPlatform**, and then select **OK** |
    | **Storage account name** text box | Enter **imgstor**_[yourname]_ |
    | **Region** drop-down list | Select **(US) East US** |
