1. On the **Visual Studio Code** pop-up select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

1.  Review the format of the **models.json** file and note that it contains an array of JSON objects, with a nested array of objects that are part of the **Products** property.

    > **Note**: This will determine the classes you'll define to deserialize the JSON file's contents before uploading it to a Cosmos DB collection.

1.  Within the **models.json** file, note that one of the properties is named **Category**.

    > **Note**: You'll use the **Category** property to define partitioning of the target Cosmos DB collection.

1.  Close Visual Studio Code.

#### Task 3: Create a Cosmos DB database and collection, and perform a JSON data upload

1.  On the **Start** screen, select the **Visual Studio Code** tile.

1.  From the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1.  In the **File Explorer** window that opens, browse to **C:\AllFiles\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure-master\Allfiles\Labs\04\Solution\AdventureWorks**, and then select **Select Folder**.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, select an empty area of the **Explorer** pane, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  From the terminal prompt, verify that the current directory is set to **AdventureWorks** (or change it to that if it's not), and then run the following command to switch your terminal context to the **AdventureWorks.Upload** folder:

    ```
    cd .\AdventureWorks.Upload\
    ```

1.  From the terminal prompt, run the following command to add the Azure Cosmos DB .NET client library to the currently opened project:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.28.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos** package from **NuGet**. For more information, refer to [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos).

1.  Observe the results of the build printed in the terminal. The build should complete successfully with no errors or warning messages.

1.  In the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, expand the **AdventureWorks.Upload** project.

1.  Open the **Program.cs** file.

1.  In the **Program.cs** file, review the **using** directives and note that they include **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos**, **System.IO;**, **System.Text.Json**, **System.Threading.Tasks**, and **System.Collections.Generic**. This enables asynchronous upload of JSON items from a local file on your lab computer to a collection in a Cosmos DB database.

1.  In the **Program.cs** file, on line 14, set the value of **EndpointUrl** by replacing the empty string with the **URI** property of the Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab. Ensure that the value is enclosed in double-quotes.

1.  On line 15, set the value of **AuthorizationKey** by replacing the empty string with the **PRIMARY KEY** property of the Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab. Ensure that the value is enclosed in double-quotes.

1.  On line 18, set the value of **PartitionKey** by replacing the empty string with **"/Category"**.

1.  On line 19, set the value of **JsonFilePath** by replacing the empty string with the given below path.

     ```
    C:\\AllFiles\\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure-master\\Allfiles\\Labs\\04\\Starter\\AdventureWorks\\AdventureWorks.Upload\\Models.json
    ```
    >Note : Verify the JsonPath accordingly and also make sure the path contains two **\\\**.

1.  Within the try block, note the invocation of the **CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync** method of the **CosmosClient** class. This will create a database if one doesn't already exist.

1.  Note the invocation of the **DefineContainer** method of the **Database** class. This will create a container that will host the JSON items if one doesn't already exist.

    > **Note**: The **DefineContainer** method includes a cost-minimizing option whereby you can modify the default indexing policy (which automatically indexes all attributes).

1.  Note the **using** statement that relies on a **StreamReader** object to read JSON items from a text file and deserializes them into objects of the **Model** class defined further in the **Program.cs** file.

1.  Note the for each loop that iterates over the collection of deserialized objects and asynchronously inserts each of them into the target collection.

1.  Review the **Model** and **Product** classes that reflect the format of the objects stored in the JSON-formatted file you reviewed earlier in this lab.

1.  Save and close the **Program.cs** file.

1.  From the terminal prompt, run the following command to restore any missing NuGet packages and build the project in the folder:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet build** command will automatically restore any missing NuGet packages prior to building all projects in the folder.

1.  From the terminal prompt, run the following command to run the .NET Core console application:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet run** command will automatically build any changes to the project and then start the web application without a debugger attached. The command will output the messages indicating the data load's progress, including the number of items inserted into the target collection and the duration of the insert operation.

1.  Observe the results of running the command printed in the terminal. The run should complete successfully, displaying the message about there being 119 items inserted into the target Cosmos DB collection.

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the terminal pane and any associated processes.

#### Task 4: Validate JSON data upload

1.  On your lab computer, switch to the **Microsoft Edge** browser window displaying the Azure portal.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade and, in the Cosmos DB accounts list, select the **polycosmosDID** Azure Cosmos DB account that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, find and select the **Data Explorer** link on the blade.

1.  In the **Data Explorer** pane, expand the **Retail** database node.

1.  Expand the **Online** container node, and then select **New SQL Query**.

    > **Note**: The label for this option might be hidden. You can display labels by hovering over the icons in the **Data Explorer** pane.

1.  On the query tab, enter the following text:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM models
    ```

1.  Select **Execute Query**, and then observe the list of JSON items returned by the query.

1.  Back in the query editor, replace the existing text with the following text:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM models
    ```

1.  Select **Execute Query**, and then observe the result of the **COUNT** aggregate operation.

1.  Switch back to the **Visual Studio Code** window.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB to insert data into Azure Cosmos DB. The web application that you implement next will use this data.

### Exercise 3: Configure a .NET web application

#### Task 1: Update references to data stores and build the web application

1.  In the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, expand the **AdventureWorks.Web** project.

1.  Open the **appsettings.json** file.

1.  In the JSON object on line 3, find the **ConnectionStrings.AdventureWorksCosmosContext** path. Note that the current value is empty:

    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "AdventureWorksCosmosContext": ""
    },
    ```

1.  Update the value of the **AdventureWorksCosmosContext** property by setting its value to the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING** of the Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  In the JSON object on line 6, find the **Settings.BlobContainerUrl** path. Note that the current value is empty:

    ```json
    "Settings": {
        "BlobContainerUrl": ""
    }
    ```

1.  Update the **BlobContainerUrl** property by setting its value to the **URL** property of the Azure Storage blob container named **images** that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  Save the **appsettings.json** file and close it.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, select an empty area of the **Explorer** pane, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  From the terminal prompt, verify that the current directory is set to **AdventureWorks.Context** (or change it to that if it's not), and then run the following command to import **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos** from NuGet:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.28.0
    ```

1.  From the terminal prompt, run the following command to build the .NET web application:
